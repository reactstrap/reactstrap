        'A switch has the markup of a custom checkbox but uses the `.form-switch` class to render a toggle switch. Consider using `role="switch"` to more accurately convey the nature of the control to assistive technologies that support this role. In older assistive technologies, it will simply be announced as a regular checkbox as a fallback. Switches also support the disabled attribute.',
